I am relearning web development with a new technology stack.</p>

<p>To do this I have started development of a simulator for one of my favourite online games Dragon Next.</p>

<p>dngearsim</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The simulator essentially lets you view details of equipment from the game.
Check out the simulator here:
<a href="http://spacem.github.io/dngearsim">http://spacem.github.io/dngearsim</a></p>

<p>This is my first angular app and still needs a lot of work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>dntviewer</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I started down this path by developing a viewer for the games dnt files which is here:
<a href="http://spacem.github.io/dntviewer">http://spacem.github.io/dntviewer</a></p>

<p>For the viewer I developed a library dntreader.js that loads dnt files and I reuse in this simulator. dntviewer is written using &gt;bootstrap with some jquery and a few third party libraries for the grid and zip file support.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do not host any files from the game on github. I do however provide links to hosted files that can be used by the simulator. Nexon have expressed support for other simulators. I am happy to remove all links to hosted files if this is deemed inappropriate.</p>
