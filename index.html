  Here are some of the projects I have worked on in my spare time.
</p>
        
<h2>
<a id="apple-nest" class="anchor" href="#apple-nest" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Apple Nest</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>A little game where you can grow apples and battle monsters.
<br>
<a href="https://apple-nest.netlify.com">https://apple-nest.netlify.com</a></p>

<p>
  My first vue.js app.
  This is a single player browser based game.
  In the game you can plant seeds, harvest apples and and sell the apples for in-game money.
  Use in-game money to upgrade your weapon and armour which will help to fight the battle.
  Like another similiar game the secret to victory is to create many characters and transfer the money to a main character via the storage npc.

<h2>
<a id="midi-peak-vis" class="anchor" href="#midi-peak-vis" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Midi Peak Vis</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>A tiny windows peak visulsation that displays using midi keyboard lights.
<br>
<a href="https://github.com/spacem/midi-peak-vis">https://github.com/spacem/midi-peak-vis</a></p>

<p>
  This tiny (16KB) app hooks into the windows mixer and lights up the keyboard in time with any sounds being played.
  It was fun to take control of the lights on my Novation Launchkey keyboard.
  I have not written any c++ for a long time but it seemed the best choice.

<h2>
<a id="dngearsim" class="anchor" href="#dngearsim" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>dngearsim</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>An equipment simulator for the game Dragon Nest.
<br>
<a href="https://dngearsim.netlify.com">https://dngearsim.netlify.com</a></p>

<p>
  This is my first angular app. I wrote this from scratch and learnt a lot along the way.
  My goal has been for it to be multi-region, single page, mobile friendly and easy to update.
  I store user builds and deploy latest game data to a simple file store based back end.

<h2>
<a id="dnskillsim" class="anchor" href="#dnskillsim" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>dnskillsim</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>A skill simulator for the game Dragon Nest.
<br>
<a href="https://spacem.github.io/dnskillsim">https://spacem.github.io/dnskillsim</a></p>

<p>
  This is a fork of a popular skill simulator for the game Dragon Nest.
  I quickly hacked it to support the latest game changes.
  I also made some changes so that it would work with multiple regions.
  Due to some node.js express specific code the application needs a server to run.
</p>
<p>
  I split the application into three parts and I deploy now in three places.
  As per the gear sim all game data is now deployed to firebase separating updates of content to the app.
  The part of the sim where you make your build is mostly someone elses code and runs on/from heroku.
  The other parts of the sim just sit on github pages for example selecting character, choosing region and publishing builds.
  This new functionality is mostly copied from dngearsim which also supports these features.

<h2>
<a id="dntviewer2" class="anchor" href="#dntviewer2" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>dntviewer2</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>
  A rewrite of dntviewer with a slightly slicker UI. My first time trying angular2.
  <a href="https://dntviewer.netlify.com">https://dntviewer.netlify.com</a>

<h2>
<a id="dntviewer" class="anchor" href="#dntviewer" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>dntviewer</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>I started down this path by developing a viewer for Dragon Nest dnt files which is here:
<a href="http://spacem.github.io/dntviewer">http://spacem.github.io/dntviewer</a></p>

<p>For the viewer I developed a library dntreader.js that loads dnt files and I reuse in this simulator.
</p>

<h2>
<a id="dntpreprocess" class="anchor" href="#dntpreprocess" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>dntpreprocess</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>I created this separate repository for maintaining scripts used to extract and optimise game data.
<a href="https://github.com/spacem/dntpreprocess">https://github.com/spacem/dntpreprocess</a></p>

<p>From the start I wanted the deployment to be a simple process.
I found it nessessary to optimise the data file formats.
Also I created some extra index files that are useful for datamining.
The scripts have grown a lot but deployment of updates remains a single step process.
</p>

<p>
  For dngearsim, dnskill sim and dntviewer I provide links to hosted files that were extracted from the game.
  Nexon have expressed support for other simulators however I am happy to remove all links to hosted files if this is deemed inappropriate.
  Artwork and details of in-game items used in these projects are the property of Nexon/Eyedentity.
